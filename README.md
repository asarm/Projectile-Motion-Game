 The main purpose of the program is modelling the projectile motion.
While doing that, reads environment file which includes game object information (obstacles and
targets) and draw them. User can set the ballâ€™s velocity and angle of movement using arrow keys.
Program controlls if the bal is inside the any game object or not. If ball touch the obstacle (blue
one), player loses the game. In addition that, if the ball goes of the screen (except the top), again,
player loses. Balls must hit red objects to win.

restart the game with key 'P'.
